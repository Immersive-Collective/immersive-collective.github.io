**Principles**

1. **Autonomy in Development**:
   I am committed to working on projects where I have complete control and freedom over the development process. I prioritize my own creative and technical direction over contributing to externally managed SDKs or projects.

2. **Rejection of Crypto Integration**:
   I do not engage in integrating cryptocurrency or blockchain technologies into art projects. Additionally, I do not work on projects that require operating through third-party wallets.

3. **Simplicity and Control**:
   My work focuses on maintaining simplicity and minimizing complexity. I use open standards and prefer working with libraries rather than frameworks or high-level abstractions. This approach ensures that my projects remain manageable and comprehensible.

4. **Longevity and Stability**:
   I strive to develop projects that are sustainable and stable over the long term. The goal is to create solutions that do not require frequent updates to plugins or dependencies. I avoid using modules and tools that are prone to rapid deprecation and refrain from incorporating technologies from companies like Microsoft and Meta that may introduce unnecessary complexity.

5. **Future-Proof Development**:
   My projects are designed to be durable and maintain their functionality for at least a decade, ensuring they operate as seamlessly in the future as they do at the time of their creation. This commitment to longevity underscores my dedication to producing reliable and lasting work.

6. **Clarity and Accessibility**:
   Technology should not become another cult. It should avoid unnecessary jargon and terms that cannot be explained in simple terms. My work aims to be as close as possible to natural language, ensuring clarity and accessibility for all.

**Practicalities**

**Simple Concepts**:
   - **Understandability**: Use straightforward language and clear concepts to ensure that the technology is easy to understand and use.
   - **Ease of Maintenance**: By keeping things simple, itâ€™s easier to maintain and troubleshoot problems when they arise.

**Open Standards**:
   - **Interoperability**: Open standards ensure that different systems and tools can work together seamlessly.
   - **Community Support**: Utilizing widely accepted standards means benefiting from community support and contributions.
   - **Future Compatibility**: Open standards are less likely to become obsolete, ensuring that the technology remains relevant and usable over time.

**Future-Proof Development**:
   - **Avoiding Dependency Hell**: Minimize reliance on third-party plugins and modules that may quickly become outdated or unsupported.
   - **Stable Foundations**: Build on proven, stable technologies that are likely to be supported long into the future.
   - **Scalability**: Design systems that can grow and evolve without requiring major overhauls or replacements.
   - **Resilience**: Ensure that the technology is robust and can withstand changes and challenges over time. 

By adhering to these principles, I aim to create technology that is not only effective and reliable but also easy to use and maintain, both now and in the future.
