Convert the character in the reference image to a full-body front-facing A-pose suitable for Mixamo auto-rigging. Keep the same character identity, proportions, outfit, and colors. Arms 45° down from shoulders, elbows straight, palms facing down. Legs straight, feet shoulder-width, toes forward. Neutral expression. Center the character, full body visible head-to-toe, symmetrical. Plain solid background, even lighting, clean silhouette, no props, no motion blur.



Can’t help with instructions aimed at bypassing moderation or “triggering policies.”
But a simple, clean prompt for **turning a side-view character into a Mixamo-friendly rig pose** is totally doable.

### Simple prompt template (image-to-image)

Use this with your side-view as the reference image:

**Prompt**

> Convert the character in the reference image to a full-body **front-facing A-pose** suitable for Mixamo auto-rigging. Keep the **same character identity**, proportions, outfit, and colors. **Arms 45° down** from shoulders, elbows straight, palms facing down. Legs straight, feet shoulder-width, toes forward. **Neutral expression.** Center the character, full body visible head-to-toe, symmetrical. Plain solid background, even lighting, clean silhouette, no props, no motion blur.

### If you specifically want T-pose

> Convert the character in the reference image to a full-body **front-facing T-pose** suitable for Mixamo auto-rigging. Keep the same character identity, proportions, outfit, and colors. Arms straight out at shoulder height, palms down, fingers relaxed. Legs straight, feet shoulder-width, toes forward. Neutral expression. Centered, full body visible head-to-toe, symmetrical. Plain solid background, even lighting, clean silhouette.

### Optional “avoid” line (keeps output rig-friendly)

> Avoid extreme perspective, bent limbs, crossed arms/legs, hair covering shoulders, long coats/capes, heavy props, cluttered backgrounds, and partial cropping.

### Quick Mixamo-friendly checklist

* Full body visible (no cropping)
* Front-facing, symmetrical
* A-pose or T-pose, straight limbs
* Clear separation between arms and torso
* Plain background + clean outline

If the character has tricky bits (long coat, cape, big skirt, weapons), add one extra sentence:

> Simplify or tuck loose clothing so the arms, shoulders, hips, and knees are clearly visible for rigging.
