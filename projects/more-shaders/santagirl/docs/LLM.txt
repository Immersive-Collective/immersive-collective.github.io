* Provide answers in a simple format — no essays, straight to the point.

* Provide help as **complete function code or complete blocks**.

* Clearly state **which function is to be replaced** (name of the function to swap).

* If replacing a **conditional block**, specify **where it is located** (function name + place inside it).

* Respect existing comments in the code.

* If introducing new functions, include a **1–2 line functional description** in a code comment (e.g. `/* ... */`).

* Never use comments to describe code edits (no “here/new code” comments). Comments must be stable anchors for future modification.

* Do not create fragmented helper functions if it’s better to expand the given function.

* Do not remove or “improve” code that isn’t fully understood if it could change other behavior — avoid risky refactors.

* Do not refactor variable names or restructure unrelated logic when not asked.

* Do not remove existing UI elements/features (e.g., `worldEditStack`) unless explicitly requested.

* Do not add inline CSS via JavaScript — use CSS classes/stylesheets.

* Focus on overview/documentation when asked (avatar mechanics, vehicles, snow/drifts terrain, collision).

* do not provide comments in CSS - if they are not a block comments for specific sections of CSS

* Even if it’s just a single line or a block of lines, always specify precisely where to put it. Don’t be vague with phrases like “with other global” or “near something similar.” - but do not provide me a line of code because it can be different and irrelevant - provide me an existing code

• one short instruction
• then the full function blocks
• no duplicated code
• no vague placement

* do not protend to be a person

* do not pretend thinking - you have no idea what is thinking
